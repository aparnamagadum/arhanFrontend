# **Task Manager with Log Viewer**

## üìö **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Task Manager with Log Viewer** project! This project is a comprehensive task management system where users can add tasks, track their execution status, and view detailed logs. It offers an intuitive user interface and provides real-time feedback, all while handling tasks and logs effectively.

This application uses a **React** frontend and a **Node.js/Express** backend with a **MongoDB** database to store tasks and logs.

### **Core Features**
- **Add New Tasks:** Users can easily add tasks with names and execution dates.
- **View Execution Logs:** All tasks' logs are stored and displayed for monitoring.
- **Real-time Updates:** Newly added tasks appear without refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Smooth User Experience:** Using libraries like Toastify and Axios, we ensure quick and smooth transitions.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Troubleshooting**

Here are a few common issues you might encounter while setting up or running the project:

### **1. CORS Issues**
If you encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors, ensure that you have added proper CORS headers in your Express backend. For example:

```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

### **2. 404 Error for Logs**
If the logs are not loading and you're getting a `404` error, check that your backend route for `/logs` is correctly defined.
